# PrimeNumber1

I have used web api to get primenumber table based on the number which has been passed by user.

Explaination of each file which has been changed as a project development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValuesControllerTest.cs is a Test cases file - Test cases
ValuesController.cs is controller file. - Web api code
PrimeNumberService.cs - Class file 
IPrimeNumberService.cs - Interface with all method declaration.
Index.cshtml - view page which you can see when you run the project.
global.asax.cs - Have all required initialization
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know how my code is going to reviewed but to make project work just create new web api project with Name "PrimeNumber". Include Test project as well.
Do the changes in above mentioned files and run it.
